Write a program in Python using PySimpleGUI for the following algorithm: We can design the finite automaton M as follows:

The set of states Q = {q0, q1, q2}, where q0 is the initial state and q2 is the only accepting state.
The input alphabet Σ = {0, 1}.
The transition function δ is defined as follows:
δ(q0, 0) = q1, δ(q0, 1) = q0
δ(q1, 0) = q2, δ(q1, 1) = q1
δ(q2, 0) = q1, δ(q2, 1) = q2
The initial state is q0.
The set of accepting states F = {q2}.

Intuitively, the automaton M starts in state q0 and reads the input symbols one by one. If the input string has odd length 
and the middle symbol is 0, then the automaton will end up in the accepting state q2. Otherwise, it will end up in a 
non-accepting state.

The transition function δ can be visualized as a directed graph, where each state is represented by a node and each transition 
is represented by a labeled edge. Here is the graph for the automaton M:

      0       1
   +----> q1 +----> q1
   |         |       
   |         |       
   |         v       
q0 +----> q2 +----> q2
In the graph, the arrows represent the transitions, and the labels on the arrows indicate the input symbols that trigger the 
transitions. The initial state is represented by a circle, and the accepting state is represented by a double circle.

This program creates a GUI with a text input for the user to enter a binary string and two buttons, "Check" and "Quit". 
When the user clicks "Check", the program simulates the finite automaton M on the input string and outputs "Accepted" or "Rejected" 
depending on whether the final state is accepting or not. The program uses the transition function transition to compute the next 
state given the current state and input symbol. The program also uses the PySimpleGUI library to create the GUI and handle user input.
